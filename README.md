# DNSAgent
A powerful "hosts" replacement.

## Features

* Use regular expression to match the domain name.
* Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.
* Support non-standard listening port (ports other than 53).
* It's possible to use DNSPod HttpDNS protocal to query for A record.
* Return a immediate address (A/AAAA record) or redirect query to a custom name server on pattern matched.
* Redirect one domain name to another, support regular expression matching and replacing.
* Local cache with custom TTL settings.
* Support source IP whitelist to filter unauthorized clients.
* Support compression pointer mutation when querying another name server. This may avoid MITM attack in some network environments.

## For Dnsmasq Users

There is a Dnsmasq to DNSAgent rules converter available to quickly make your Dnsmasq rules working with this program:

https://stackia.github.io/masq2agent/

## Usage

Edit `options.cfg` to change options.

Edit `rules.cfg` to customize your rules.

Both `options.cfg` and `rules.cfg` are standord JSON files, your can use any of your favorite editors to open them.

Launch `DNSAgent.exe` and **change your system DNS to 127.0.0.1**. Voil√†!

## Configuration

You can choose to install DNSAgent as a Windows service by running `Install as Service.bat`. And `Uninstall Service.bat` to remove this service.

A sample configuration:

### options.cfg:
```
{
    "HideOnStart": false,
    "ListenOn": "127.0.0.1:53, [::1]",
    "DefaultNameServer": "119.29.29.29",
    "UseHttpQuery": false,
    "QueryTimeout": 4000,
    "CompressionMutation": false,
    "CacheResponse": true,
    "CacheAge": 86400,
    "NetworkWhitelist": null
}
```

Set `CacheResponse` to `false` will disable local cache. Set CacheAge to 0 will use the DNS response's record TTL as cache TTL.

Set `UseHttpQuery` to `true` will use [DNSPod HttpDNS](https://www.dnspod.cn/httpdns/demo) procotal to query the name server. HttpDNS protocol doesn't support IPv6.

If you want to filter source IP, you can set `NetworkWhitelist` with the following format ([CIDR notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) is used below):
```
    "NetworkWhitelist": [
        "127.0.0.1/32",
        "192.168.199.0/24"
    ]
```
WARNING: Set `NetworkWhitelist` to `[]` will deny all requests. If you want to disable source IP filting, set `NetworkWhitelist` to `null`.

### rules.cfg:
```
[
    {
        "Pattern": "^(.*\\.mydomain\\.com)|((.*\\.)?(yourdomain|hisdomain)\\.com)$",
        "Address": "112.223.221.26"
    },
    {
        "Pattern": "^www\\.google\\.com\\.hk$",
        "Address": "www.google.com",
        "NameServer": "8.8.4.4",
        "CompressionMutation": true
    },
    {
        "Pattern": "^(.*)\\.mysuffix\\.com$",
        "Address": "{1}"
    },
    {
        "Pattern": "^www\\.google\\.com\\.tw$",
        "Address": "www.google.com",
        "NameServer": "127.0.0.1"
    },
    {
        "Pattern": "^www\\.google\\.co\\.jp$",
        "Address": "www.google.com"
    },
    {
        "Pattern": "^www\\.google\\.cn$",
        "NameServer": "114.114.114.114"
    },
    {
        "Pattern": "^.*\\.cn$",
        "NameServer": "119.29.29.29",
        "UseHttpQuery": true,
        "QueryTimeout": 1000
    }
]
```

When a domain name matchs mutiple rules, the last one is used.

You can use {0}/{1}/{2}/... to insert regular expression group match result in "Address" field.

IPv6 address will only be returned when the client querys for AAAA records.

`ListenOn` / `DefaultNameServer` / `NameServer` field can be of following formats:

```
127.0.0.1 // IPv4 address with a default port 53
127.0.0.1:9029 // IPv4 address with a custom port 9029
2001:4860:4860::8888 // IPv6 address with a default port 53
[2001:4860:4860::8888]:9029 // IPv6 address with a custom port 9029
```

You can press `Ctrl + R` to reload all configurations and clear cache without restart this program.
